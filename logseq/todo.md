# Logseq Custom CSS Theme
ID:202402082014

- Looking quite nice so far. I'm going for something that looks kinda similar to Github Dark Dimmed.

TODO:
- Find the declarations for all the hover preview colours.
- Tag & Links consistent colour.
- Background we see at the edges on loading is still that dark logseq green.
- How does it look on mobile?
